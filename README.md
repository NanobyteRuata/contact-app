# ContactsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.0.

## JSON-Server

Run `npm install` after cloning or downloading.

## JSON-Server

Run `json-server db.json --middlewares middleware.js` for a fake server. Make sure it runs on `http://localhost:3000`. However, if you have a dedicated server for these contacts or if u decided not to run on port 3000, you will need to change BASE_URL value in "api-constants.ts" according to your configuration.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
